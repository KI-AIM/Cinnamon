    <h3>Welcome to Cinnamon. This tool is designed to anonymize your data by providing methods both for direct
        anonymization as well as data generation with synthetic methods. </h3>

    <p>Read the information on this page carefully and continue with the

        <button mat-raised-button color="primary" (click)="selectMode(Mode.STANDARD);" [disabled]="locked">
            Start
        </button>

        button.
    </p>

    <p>Later in development you will be able to choose different modes here. For now, only the standard mode is implemented.</p>

    <p>The application will guide you through the different steps, that are shown on the left side of the screen.
        Completed
        steps will be marked accordingly. The steps can be grouped into three categories: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Upload of the data</li>
        <li>Configuration and execution of the anonymization</li>
        <li>Evaluation of the anonymized data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>During the data upload, the metadata for the source data is configured.
        The anonymization and evaluation is precede by two configuration pages for configuring the algorithms.
        Elements will be marked by
        <mat-icon fontIcon="info" style="vertical-align: bottom;"></mat-icon>
        if they have an explanation attached to them.
        It is possible to always switch back to completed steps, to adjust the configuration. Be aware that this will
        delete
        the results of completed steps following the modified configuration.
    </p>

                <p>The standard mode is designed for inexperienced users. It will provide some automatic suggestions for
                    useful configuration of the platform. It will also provide a guided setup and more detailed description
                    of every component. This however comes with a tradeoff, that the different methods might not be as
                    customizable resulting in worse anonymization results.</p>

                <p>The expert mode is designed for experienced users that know much about anonymization and synthetization
                    methods. This mode offers a more sophisticated interface to configure every component of the platform.
                    Not much guidance is provided in this mode, but fine tuning ever method will likely result in better
                    anonymization results.</p>

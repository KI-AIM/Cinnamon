configurations:
  model_parameter:
    display_name: Model Architecture
    description: Define the model parameters, used to configure the architecture and training of the adversarial model.
    parameters:
      - name: num_trees
        type: integer
        label: Number of Trees
        description: Adding more trees allows the model to capture more patterns from the training data, which can lead to more realistic and diverse synthetic samples, but increases time and memory usage.
        default_value: 30
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 100
      - name: min_node_size
        type: integer
        label: Minimum Node Size
        description: Minimum number of samples required to split a node. Smaller values can make the model focus too much on small data variations, while larger values may cause it to overlook meaningful patterns.
        default_value: 5
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 100
  model_fitting:
    display_name: Model Fitting
    description: Parameters for setting up how to train and test the model with your data.
    parameters:
      - name: max_iters
        type: integer
        label: Maximum Iterations
        description: The maximum number of iterations for training until accuracy plateaus. More iterations can improve synthetic data quality but may reduce diversity.
        default_value: 10
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000
  sampling:
    display_name: Sampling
    description: Parameters for generating synthetic data from the trained model.
    parameters:
      - name: num_samples
        type: integer
        label: Number of Samples
        description: The number of synthetic data samples to generate.
        default_value: 1000
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000000

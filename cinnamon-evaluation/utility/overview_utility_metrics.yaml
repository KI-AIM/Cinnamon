      description: "Quantifies the performance similarity of machine learning models trained on protected data compared to those trained on real data."
      interpretation: "Score ranges from 0 to 1, where:
        - 1.0: Perfect utility - protected data performs identically to real data
        - >0.8: Excellent utility
        - 0.6-0.8: Good utility
        - 0.4-0.6: Moderate utility
        - <0.4: Poor utility - significant difference in model performance
        Values closer to 1 indicate that models trained on protected data achieve similar performance to those trained on real data."

      description: "Measures how easily a machine learning classifier can distinguish between real and protected data."
      interpretation: "Score ranges from 0 to 1, where:
        - 0.5: Ideal score - classifier cannot distinguish between real and protected data
        - 0.5-0.6: Very good protected data quality
        - 0.6-0.7: Good protected data quality
        - 0.7-0.8: Moderate protected data quality
        - >0.8: Poor protected data quality - classifier can easily distinguish protected from real data
        Values closer to 0.5 indicate better quality protected data, as the discriminator struggles to differentiate between real and protected samples."

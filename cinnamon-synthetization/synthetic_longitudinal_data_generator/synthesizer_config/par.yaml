type: longitudinal
display_name: Probabilistic Auto-Regressive Model
description: Is a model for synthesizing longitudinal data.
URL: /start_synthetization_process/par
configurations:
  model_parameter:
    display_name: Model Parameters
    description: Define the model parameters, that are used for training the model. The model parameters are used to configure the model architecture and training process.
    parameter:
      - name: epochs
        type: integer
        label: Number of Epochs
        description: Number of training epochs. Fewer epochs may lead the model to learn only basic patterns, while more epochs help capture complex structures. Very high values can cause the model to memorize the training data instead of learning to generalize.
        default_value: 300
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 10000
      - name: sample_size
        type: integer
        label: Number of Samples
        description: Number of times the model will generate a sequence for a given context before selecting the best one based on the highest log likelihood. Enhances the modelâ€™s ability to generate a more accurate and reliable sequence.
        default_value: 1
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 10
  model_fitting:
    display_name: Model Fitting
    description: Define the model fitting parameters, that are used for training the model. The model fitting parameters are used to configure the model fitting process.
    parameters:
      - name: train
        type: float
        label: Train
        description: Configure the Train set. Configure the Train dataset. The remaining data is used for the test dataset. If a test dataset is desired the value should be lower then 1.0.
        default_value: 0.8
        min_value: 0.0
        max_value: 1.0
  sampling:
    display_name: Sampling
    description: Define the sampling parameters, that are used for generating synthetic data. The sampling parameters are used to configure the number of samples.
    parameters:
      - name: num_samples
        type: integer
        label: Samples
        description: The number of entities to sample.
        default_value: 10000
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000000

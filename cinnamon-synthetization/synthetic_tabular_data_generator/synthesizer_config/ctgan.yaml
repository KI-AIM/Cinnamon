name: ctgan
version: "0.1"
type: cross-sectional
display_name: Conditional Tabular GAN
description: Is a GAN for synthesizing cross-sectional data.

configurations:
  model_parameter:
    display_name: Model Architecture
    description: Define the model parameters, that are used for training the model. The model parameters are used to configure the model architecture and training process.
    parameters:
      - name: embedding_dim
        type: integer
        label: Embedding Dimensions
        description: Embedding Dimensions controls how much detail the model can capture when learning from the data. Higher values allow the model to represent more differences between data points, while lower values may lead to simpler, more compressed representations.
        default_value: 128
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000
      - name: generator_dim
        type: list
        label: Generator Dimensions
        description: Fewer dimensions or smaller values create a simpler network that trains faster but may struggle to capture complex patterns.
        default_value: [256, 256, 256]
      - name: discriminator_dim
        type: list
        label: Discriminator Dimensions
        description: The discriminator learns to strictly evaluate how synthetic or real the data is. To keep training balanced, discriminator_dim should have similar dimenesions and values as generator_dim
        default_value: [256, 256, 256]
  model_fitting:
    display_name: Training Parameters
    description: Define the model fitting parameters, that are used for training the model. The model fitting parameters are used to configure the training data and the test data.
    parameters:
      - name: batch_size
        type: integer
        label: Batch Size
        description: Controls how many samples are used per training step. Lower batch sizes can increase diversity but add noise; higher batch sizes make the data more consistent but may miss subtle variations.
        default_value: 128
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1024
      - name: epochs
        type: integer
        label: Number of Epochs
        description: Number of training epochs. Fewer epochs may lead the model to learn only basic patterns, while more epochs help capture complex structures. Very high values can cause the model to memorize the training data instead of learning to generalize.
        default_value: 300
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 10000
  sampling:
    display_name: Sampling
    description: Define the sampling parameters, that are used for generating the synthetic data. The sampling parameters are used to configure the number of samples.
    parameters:
      - name: num_samples
        type: integer
        label: Samples
        description: Configure the Samples.
        default_value: 1000
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000000

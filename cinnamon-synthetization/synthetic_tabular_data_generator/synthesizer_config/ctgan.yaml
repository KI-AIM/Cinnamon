    display_name: Model Architecture
    description: Define the model parameters, that are used for training the model. The model parameters are used to configure the model architecture and training process.
    parameters:
      - name: embedding_dim
        type: integer
        label: Embedding Dimensions
        description: is the size of the initial random input vector that is passed to the generator. This vector is a latent vector representing a point in the latent space, from which the generator will produce synthetic data. The embedding_dim determines the dimensionality of this latent space vector. A higher embedding_dim provides a larger latent space, potentially allowing the generator to capture more complex patterns and variations in the data. Conversely, a lower embedding_dim might limit the capacity of the generator to capture complex relationships.

      - name: generator_dim
        type: list
        label: Generator Dimensions
        description: Refers to the sizes of the intermediate layers in the generator network of a generative model. Given as a tuple or list where each number specifies the number of neurons in a corresponding layer, it determines the structure and capacity of the generator, influencing how well it can produce realistic synthetic data. If the dimensions are too small, the generated data might lack detail. Larger values allow for more detailed and realistic synthetic data.
        default_value: [256, 256, 256]
      - name: discriminator_dim
        type: list
        label: Discriminator Dimensions
        description: the sizes of the intermediate layers in the discriminator network of the GAN. Given as a tuple or list where each number specifies the number of neurons in a corresponding layer, it determines the structure and capacity of the discriminator, influencing how well it can distinguish between real and fake data. If the dimensions are too small, the discriminator might not be effective. Larger values help the discriminator become more accurate, leading to the generation of more realistic data.
        default_value: [256, 256, 256]
  model_fitting:
    display_name: Training Parameters
    description: Define the model fitting parameters, that are used for training the model. The model fitting parameters are used to configure the training data and the test data.
    parameters:
      - name: batch_size
        type: integer
        label: Batch Size
        description: Number of training samples processed before the model's internal parameters are updated. It affects memory usage, training speed, gradient estimation, and overall training dynamics. Smaller values might produce less consistent results, while larger values can help generate more reliable synthetic data.
        default_value: 128

<h3>Welcome to the KI-AIM platform. This tool is designed to anonymize your data by providing methods both for direct
    anonymization as well as data generation with synthetic methods. </h3>

<br />
<p>The application will guide you through the different steps, that are shown on the left side of the screen. Completed
    steps will be marked accordingly. It is possible to always switch back to completed steps, to adjust the
    configuration. Elements will be marked by <mat-icon fontIcon="info"></mat-icon> if they have an explanation
    attatched to them. </p>

            <p>The standard mode is designed for inexperienced users. It will provide some automatic suggestions for
                useful configuration of the platform. It will also provide a guided setup and more detailed description
                of every component. This however comes with a tradeoff, that the different methods might not be as
                customizable resulting in worse anonymization results.</p>

            <p>The expert mode is designed for experienced users that know much about anonymization and synthetization
                methods. This mode offers a more sophisticated interface to configure every component of the platform.
                Not much guidance is provided in this mode, but fine tuning ever method will likely result in better
                anonymization results.</p>

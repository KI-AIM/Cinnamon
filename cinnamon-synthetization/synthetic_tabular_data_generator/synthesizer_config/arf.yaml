configurations:
  model_parameter:
    display_name: Model Architecture
    description: Define the architecture of the model.
    parameters:
      - name: num_trees
        type: integer
        label: Number of Trees
        description: Adding more trees allows the model to capture more patterns from the training data, which can lead to more realistic and diverse synthetic samples, but increases time and memory usage. A high number of tress leads to longer training times.
        default_value: 30
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 100
      - name: min_node_size
        type: integer
        label: Minimum Node Size
        description: Smaller values can make the model focus too much on small data variations, while larger values may cause it to overlook meaningful patterns.
        default_value: 5
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 100
  model_fitting:
    display_name: Model Fitting
    description: Define the parameters, that are used for training the model.
    parameters:
      - name: max_iters
        type: integer
        label: Maximum Iterations
        description: The maximum number of iterations for training until accuracy plateaus. More iterations can improve synthetic data quality but may reduce diversity. Higher values lead to longer training times.
        default_value: 10
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000
  sampling:
    display_name: Sampling
    description: Define the sampling parameters, that are used for generating the synthetic data. 
    parameters:
      - name: num_samples
        type: integer
        label: Number of Samples
        description: The number of synthetic data samples to generate. A high number of samples will increase the time required for sampling.
        default_value: 1000
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000000

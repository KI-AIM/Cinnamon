  model_parameter:
    display_name: Model Architecture
    description: Define the model architecture and training process.
    parameters:
      - name: embedding_dim
        type: integer
        label: Embedding Dimensions
        description: Embedding Dimensions controls how much detail the model can capture when learning from the data. Higher values allow the model to represent more differences between data points, while lower values may lead to simpler, more compressed representations. Using low values can reduce training time.
        default_value: 128
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000
      - name: generator_dim
        type: list
        label: Generator Dimensions
        description: Fewer dimensions or smaller values create a simpler network that trains faster but may struggle to capture complex patterns.
        default_value: [256, 256]
      - name: discriminator_dim
        type: list
        label: Discriminator Dimensions
        description: The discriminator learns to strictly evaluate how synthetic or real the data is. To keep training balanced, the discriminator should have similar dimenesions and values as the generator. Smaller dimensions tend to reduce the training time.
        default_value: [256, 256]
  model_fitting:
    display_name: Training Parameters
    description: Define the parameters, that are used for training the model. 
    parameters:
      - name: batch_size
        type: integer
        label: Batch Size
        description: Controls how many samples are used per training step. Lower batch sizes can increase diversity but add noise, higher batch sizes make the data more consistent but may miss subtle variations. Low values lead to longer training times.
        default_value: 128
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1024
      - name: epochs
        type: integer
        label: Number of Epochs
        description: Fewer epochs may lead the model to learn only basic patterns, while more epochs help capture complex structures. Very high values can cause the model to memorize the training data instead of learning to generalize. Higher values lead to longer training times.
        default_value: 100
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 10000
  sampling:
    display_name: Sampling
    description: Define the sampling parameters, that are used for generating the synthetic data. 
    parameters:
      - name: num_samples
        type: integer
        label: Samples
        description: The number of synthetic data samples to generate. A high number of samples will increase the time required for sampling.
        default_value: 1000
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000000

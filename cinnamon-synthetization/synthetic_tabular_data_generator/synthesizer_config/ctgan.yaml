name: ctgan
version: "0.1"
type: cross-sectional
display_name: Conditional Tabular GAN
description: Is a GAN for synthesizing cross-sectional data.
URL: /start_synthetization_process/ctgan
configurations:
  model_parameter:
    display_name: Model Architecture
    description: Define the model parameters, that are used for training the model. The model parameters are used to configure the model architecture and training process.
    parameters:
      - name: embedding_dim
        type: integer
        label: Embedding Dimensions
        description: The embedding dimension is the size of the input noise vector. Lower values may lead to low diversity in the generated data, while higher values can produce more diverse data patterns
        default_value: 128
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000
      - name: generator_dim
        type: list
        label: Generator Dimensions
        description: Each value in the tuple represents one processing stage in the network. Fewer stages or smaller values create a simpler network that trains faster but may struggle to capture complex patterns.
        default_value: [256, 256, 256]
      - name: discriminator_dim
        type: list
        label: Discriminator Dimensions
        description: The discriminator learns to strictly evaluate how synthetic or real the data is. To keep training balanced, discriminator_dim should have a similar stages and values as generator_dim
        default_value: [256, 256, 256]
  model_fitting:
    display_name: Training Parameters
    description: Define the model fitting parameters, that are used for training the model. The model fitting parameters are used to configure the training data and the test data.
    parameters:
      - name: batch_size
        type: integer
        label: Batch Size
        description: each column is divided into groups of size batch_size, meaning the model processes batch_size samples per column in each training step. Low batch_size leads to noisier but faster updates, while high batch_size results in more stable training
        default_value: 128
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1024
      - name: epochs
        type: integer
        label: Number of Epochs
        description: Number of training epochs. The process does not stop automatically when the model's performance plateaus.
        default_value: 300
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 10000
  sampling:
    display_name: Sampling
    description: Define the sampling parameters, that are used for generating the synthetic data. The sampling parameters are used to configure the number of samples.
    parameters:
      - name: num_samples
        type: integer
        label: Samples
        description: Configure the Samples.
        default_value: 1000
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000000

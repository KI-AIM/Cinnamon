configurations:
  model_parameter:
    display_name: Model Architecture
    description: Define the model parameters, that are used for training the model. The model parameters are used to configure the model architecture and training process.
    parameters:
      - name: embedding_dim
        type: integer
        label: Embedding Dimensions
        description: The size of the latent space (embedding_dim) controls the capacity of the model. Larger embedding_dim enables the model to capture more intricate patterns and details but at the cost of increased computational complexity and risk of overfitting. Smaller embedding_dim simplifies the model and reduces computational requirements but may result in loss of detail and lower-quality data reconstructions.
        default_value: 128
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000
      - name: compress_dims
        type: list
        label: Compress Dimensions
        description: The size of each hidden layer in the encoder. The size of each layer (defined by compress_dims) affects how well the encoder can learn and represent the underlying structure of the input data. Larger layer sizes allow the model to potentially capture more detailed features but also increase the risk of overfitting (too specific to the training data).
        default_value: [128, 128]
      - name: decompress_dims
        type: list
        label: Decompress Dimensions
        description: The size of each layer (defined by decompress_dims) affects how well the decoder can reconstruct the original data from the latent representation. Larger layer sizes can capture more detailed aspects of the data, potentially improving reconstruction quality but also increasing the risk of overfitting (too specific to the training data) and computational expense.
        default_value: [128, 128]

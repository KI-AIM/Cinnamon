configurations:
  model_parameter:
    display_name: Model Architecture
    description: Define the architecture of the model.
    parameters:
      - name: encoder_max_clusters
        type: integer
        label: Maximum Number of Data Clusters
        description: Fewer clusters produce more general synthetic data that may miss important details. More clusters allow the model to generate data with finer structure, but if too specific, this can lead to data leakage from the training set.
        default_value: 10
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 50
      - name: encoder_noise_scale
        type: float
        label: Encoder Noise Scale
        description: Small random noise added to the data to prevent leakage of information from the training set into the generated data.
        default_value: 0.01
        min_value: 0.0
        max_value: 1.0

    display_name: Training Parameters
    description: Define the parameters, that are used for training the model.
    parameters:
      - name: struct_learning_n_iter
        type: integer
        label: Iterations
        description: The number of times the model will try to learn the best network structure. More iterations can help improve the structure. Higher values lead to longer training times.
        default_value: 100
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000
  sampling:
    display_name: Sampling
    description: Define the sampling parameters, that are used for generating the synthetic data. 
    parameters:
      - name: num_samples
        type: integer
        label: Number of Samples
        description: The number of synthetic data samples to generate. A high number of samples will increase the time required for sampling.
        default_value: 1000
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000000

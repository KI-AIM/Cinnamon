name: tvae
version: "0.1"
type: cross-sectional
display_name: Tabular Variational Autoencoder
description: Is a VAE for synthesizing cross-sectional data.

configurations:
  model_parameter:
    display_name: Model Architecture
    description: Define the model parameters, that are used for training the model. The model parameters are used to configure the model architecture and training process.
    parameters:
      - name: embedding_dim
        type: integer
        label: Embedding Dimensions
        description: embedding_dim controls how much detail the model can capture when learning from the data. Higher values allow the model to represent more differences between data points, while lower values may lead to simpler, more compressed representations.
        default_value: 128
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000
      - name: compress_dims
        type: list
        label: Compress Dimensions
        description: Each value in the tuple represents one processing stage in the network. Fewer stages or smaller values create a simpler network that trains faster but may struggle to capture complex patterns.
        default_value: [128, 128]
      - name: decompress_dims
        type: list
        label: Decompress Dimensions
        description: Each value in the tuple represents one processing stage in the network. Fewer stages or smaller values create a simpler network that trains faster but may struggle to capture complex patterns. To keep training balanced, Decompress Dimensions should have a similar stages and values as Compress Dimensions
        default_value: [128, 128]
  model_fitting:
    display_name: Training Parameters
    description: Define the model fitting parameters, that are used for training the model. The model fitting parameters are used to configure the training process.
    parameters:
      - name: batch_size
        type: integer
        label: Batch Size
        description: Each column is divided into groups of size batch_size, meaning the model processes batch_size samples per column in each training step. Low batch_size leads to noisier but faster updates, while high batch_size results in more stable training
        default_value: 100
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000
      - name: epochs
        type: integer
        label: Number of Epochs
        description: Number of training epochs. The process does not stop automatically when the model's performance plateaus.
        default_value: 300
  sampling:
    display_name: Sampling
    description: Define the sampling parameters, that are used for generating synthetic data. The sampling parameters are used to configure the number of samples.
    parameters:
      - name: num_samples
        type: integer
        label: Samples
        description: Configure the Samples.
        default_value: 1000
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000000

  display_name: Utility Metrics
  description: Utility metrics are used to evaluate how well synthetic data replicates the utility of the real data. These metrics typically compare model performance between real and synthetic data.
  metrics:
    - display_name: "Machine Learning Utility"
      function_name: machine_learning
      description: "Measures how well a machine learning model performs on synthetic data compared to real data."
      interpretation: "Score ranges from 0 to 1, where:
        - 1.0: Perfect utility - synthetic data performs identically to real data
        - >0.8: Excellent utility
        - 0.6-0.8: Good utility
        - 0.4-0.6: Moderate utility
        - <0.4: Poor utility - significant difference in model performance
        Values closer to 1 indicate that models trained on synthetic data achieve similar performance to those trained on real data."

    - display_name: "Discriminator-based Evaluation"
      function_name: discriminator_based_evaluation
      description: "Discriminator-Based Evaluation involves training a machine learning classifier to distinguish between real and synthetic data, with poor classification performance indicating high-quality synthetic data that closely resembles the real data."
      interpretation: "Score ranges from 0 to 1, where:
        - 0.5: Ideal score - classifier cannot distinguish between real and synthetic data
        - 0.5-0.6: Very good synthetic data quality
        - 0.6-0.7: Good synthetic data quality
        - 0.7-0.8: Moderate synthetic data quality
        - >0.8: Poor synthetic data quality - classifier can easily distinguish synthetic from real data
        Values closer to 0.5 indicate better quality synthetic data, as the discriminator struggles to differentiate between real and synthetic samples."

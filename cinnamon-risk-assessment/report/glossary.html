	<div class="report-glossary-term-title">Privacy Risk</div>
	<div class="report-glossary-term-definition">
		A privacy risk is the possibility that an attacker could extract information about individuals from a released
		dataset&mdash;whether original, anonymized, or synthetic.
		<br>
		Residual privacy risks remain even after applying anonymization or generating synthetic data. These risks must
		be assessed through attack models (like singling out, linkability, attribute inference).
	</div>
</div>

<div class="report-glossary-term">
	<div class="report-glossary-term-title">Singling Out</div>
	<div class="report-glossary-term-definition">
		Singling out occurs when an attacker can deduce that exactly one individual exists in the original dataset who
		matches a given combination of attribute values.
	</div>
</div>

<div class="report-glossary-term">
	<div class="report-glossary-term-title">Data Linkage / Linkability</div>
	<div class="report-glossary-term-definition">
		Linkability is the possibility of linking two or more records&mdash;one dataset or across multiple
		datasets&mdash;that belong to the same individual or group of individuals. This can lead to re-identification or
		information gain about these individuals or the group. Data linkage has historically led to full
		de-anonymization of datasets and is still possible with synthetic data because of statistical similarities to
		the real data.

</div>

<div class="report-glossary-term">
	<div class="report-glossary-term-title">Inference / Attribute Inference</div>
	<div class="report-glossary-term-definition">
		Inference risk arises when an attacker can confidently guess the value of an unknown or secret attribute of a
		real individual by exploiting an anonymized or synthetic dataset. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive
		information like a diagnosis or to identify specifically vulnerable individuals.

<div class="report-glossary-term">
	<div class="report-glossary-term-title">Privacy Score (Composite Privacy Risk Score)</div>
	<div class="report-glossary-term-definition">
		A Privacy Score is an aggregation of the three specific privacy risks:
		<ol>
			<li>Singling-out Risk</li>
			<li>Linkability Risk</li>
			<li>Inference (Attribute) Risk</li>
		</ol>
		Each of these is computed via the risk score formula for its corresponding attack.
		<br>
		The overall Privacy Score represents a high-level summary of how much the synthetic dataset leaks
		individual-level information across all key dimensions defined by GDPR and aligned with the Article 29 Working
		Party. The implementations of the individual risk scores are based on the Anonymeter Framework from Giomi et al.
	</div>
	<div class="report-glossary-term-interpretation">
		<ul>
			<li>High values mean the synthetic dataset reveals too much about specific individuals.</li>
			<li>Low values indicate that information leaked is mostly generic population-level information.</li>

<div class="report-glossary-term">
	<div class="report-glossary-term-title">Privacy Risk Score</div>
	<div class="report-glossary-term-definition">
		A Privacy Risk Score represents the estimated specific privacy risk for a given attack type (singling out,
		linkability, inference). It measures how much more successful an attacker is when targeting training records
		(which influenced the synthetic data) compared to control records (independent of the synthetic data).

<div class="report-glossary-term">
	<div class="report-glossary-term-title">Risk Confidence Interval</div>
	<div class="report-glossary-term-definition">
		A Risk Confidence Interval quantifies the statistical uncertainty of the risk estimate due to the finite number
		of attack trials.

	<div class="report-glossary-term-title">Successful Attack Rate</div>
	<div class="report-glossary-term-definition">
		The Successful Attack Ratio (also referred to as the success rate) is the proportion of attacker guesses that
		were correct.

<div class="report-glossary-term">
	<div class="report-glossary-term-title">Error Rate</div>
	<div class="report-glossary-term-definition">
		In Anonymeter, the Error Rate represents the uncertainty of the success-rate estimate and is expressed as the
		margin of error from the Wilson score interval.

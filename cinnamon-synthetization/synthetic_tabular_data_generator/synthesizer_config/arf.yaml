    display_name: Model Architecture
    description: Define the model parameters, used to configure the architecture and training of the adversarial model.
    parameters:
      - name: num_trees
        type: integer
        label: Number of Trees
        description: Smaller values may appropriate when the convergence is large, in order to regularize the forest. Adding more trees tends to improve density estimates, though this incurs extra computational cost in time and memory.
        default_value: 30
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 100
      - name: min_node_size
        type: integer
        label: Minimum Node Size
        description: Minimum node size is the threshold of samples below which a node cannot be split and becomes a leaf. Smaller values lead the trees to grow too deep, and leaves will not contain enough data to accurately estimate marginal densities; higher node size value lead the trees to grow too shallow, and ARFs may not satisfy the local independence criterion.
        default_value: 5
        min_value: 1

    parameters:
      - name: max_iters

        label: Maximum Iterations
        description: The maximum number of iterations for training until accuracy plateaus.

        description: The number of synthetic data samples to generate.

  model_parameter:
    display_name: Model Parameters
    description: Define the model parameters, that are used for training the model. The model parameters are used to configure the model architecture and training process.
    parameters:
      - name: embedding_dim
        type: integer
        label: Embedding Dimensions
        description: The size of the latent space (embedding_dim) controls the capacity of the model. Larger embedding_dim enables the model to capture more intricate patterns and details but at the cost of increased computational complexity and risk of overfitting. Smaller embedding_dim simplifies the model and reduces computational requirements but may result in loss of detail and lower-quality data reconstructions.
        default_value: 128
        min_value: 1
        max_value: 1000
      - name: compress_dims
        type: list
        label: Compress Dimensions
        description: The size of each hidden layer in the encoder. The size of each layer (defined by compress_dims) affects how well the encoder can learn and represent the underlying structure of the input data. Larger layer sizes allow the model to potentially capture more detailed features but also increase the risk of overfitting (too specific to the training data).
        default_value: [128, 128]
      - name: decompress_dims
        type: list
        label: Decompress Dimensions
        description: The size of each layer (defined by decompress_dims) affects how well the decoder can reconstruct the original data from the latent representation. Larger layer sizes can capture more detailed aspects of the data, potentially improving reconstruction quality but also increasing the risk of overfitting (too specific to the training data) and computational expense.
        default_value: [128, 128]
      - name: l2scale
        type: float
        label: L2Scale
        description: Weight of L2 regularization applied during the training of the model. A very small value (like 1e-5) means the regularization effect is minimal, which might be suitable if the model is complex or if there is enough regularization already. Increasing l2scale adds more regularization, which can be useful if the model is overfitting (too specific to the training data) but might also lead to underfitting (too simplistic model, resulting in poor predictions) if set too high.
        default_value: 0.00001
        min_value: 0.00001
        max_value: 1.0
      - name: loss_factor
        type: integer
        label: Loss Factor
        description: A multiplier that scales the reconstruction error in the loss function, affecting how much weight the reconstruction error has in the total loss calculation. This tells the model how important it is to accurately recreate the input data. A higher value makes the model focus more on accuracy, which can make the generated data look more realistic but might also make it less varied.
        default_value: 2
      - name: epochs
        type: integer
        label: Number of Epochs
        description: Number of training epochs.
        default_value: 300
  model_fitting:
    display_name: Model Fitting
    description: Define the model fitting parameters, that are used for training the model. The model fitting parameters are used to configure the training process.
    parameters:
      - name: train
        type: float
        label: Train
        description: Configure the Train dataset. The remaining data is used for the test dataset. If a test dataset is desired the value should be lower then 1.0.
        default_value: 0.8
  sampling:
    display_name: Sampling
    description: Define the sampling parameters, that are used for generating synthetic data. The sampling parameters are used to configure the number of samples.
    parameters:
      - name: num_samples
        type: integer
        label: Samples
        description: Configure the Samples.

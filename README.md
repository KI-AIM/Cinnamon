Cinnamon is a modular application designed to offer robust functionalities for data anonymization, synthetization, and evaluation.

The platform has been developed as part of the [KI-AIM](https://www.forschung-it-sicherheit-kommunikationssysteme.de/projekte/ki-aim) project.

## Key-Features

- **Modular Framework**: Cinnamon's design makes it simple to add new features and functionalities. This modular
  approach ensures the platform can be customized to fit specific requirements.


- **Data Anonymization and Synthetization**: By incorporating methods for anonymizing and synthetizing data, Cinnamon
  helps protect sensitive information while still allowing for data use.


- **Comprehensive Evaluation Module**: The evaluation module provides clear, concise results, converting complex data
  protection processes into understandable insights.


- **Support for Various Data Formats**: Cinnamon handles multiple data formats, including CSV and Excel, and we're
  working to include support for medical formats like FHIR, enabling versatility across industries.


- **Guided Workflow**: Cinnamon offers guidance through complex data protection functions, making it accessible to users
  regardless of their experience level.
